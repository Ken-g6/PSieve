0.3.10b Added -T to TPS.

0.3.10a Fixed Linux threads.

0.3.10	Added Twin Prime Search capability into this codebase.
	BOINC Linux version again uses threads, to prevent a mystery slowdown.
	Also added -M and -s (replacing the old -s that's now -a).

0.3.9	Factors tested against even more small primes! Up to 32768 takes .2s/WU

0.3.8	Factors tested against more small primes.
	Per Rytis' request, 30% fewer factors are now returned.
	Also forced all 64-bit Intel machines to use the standard algorithm.

0.3.7	BOINC version no longer uses threads at all!  Fixes suspend, Mac status.
	Also caught and re-raised some signals, if it matters.

0.3.6a	Fixed a checkpointing bug when pmin comes from ppconfig.txt
	Also better detection of Phenom II processors.

0.3.6	Faster processing for very low P, ~2-3*Kmax.
	Also made .S files to compile on an older Linux, 32-bit works on 2.6.8

0.3.5	- 32-bit version now detects SSE2 and runs appropriate code.
	- In case of threading errors (e.g. Win98), now runs as a single thread.

0.3.4b	Technical BOINC changes to make compilation easier.
	Preeminent among these is switching off the multi-thread setup function.

0.3.4a	Fixed a checkpointing bug with BOINC.

0.3.4	- Added BOINC code
	- Added Riesel numbers.

0.3.3b	Eliminated K*2^N+1 divisible by 3, 5, or 7, when not using a sieve file.

0.3.3a	Bug workaround for 64-bit Windows *only*.

0.3.3	Speed improvements for 64-bit, ~3% on Core 2, ~13% on Athlon64.

	The alternate algorithm no longer uses SSE2 on 64-bit.  So the switch
	is now "--alt"; "--sse2" is deprecated.

	Shell script selects the alternate algorithm for AMD processors.

	Linux binary minimum requirements: kernel 2.6.15, GlibC 2.3.4

0.3.2a	A very tiny bugfix that only affects you if you try to run with fewer
	than the maximum number of N's.

	Also doubled the speed...of reading the input ABCD file.

0.3.2	Added an option to choose between the default and alternate SSE2 
	algorithms, when possible.  Also tweaked benchmark very slightly.

	Fixed an ETA bug that went out in the Windows apps, but not Linux.
	Windows apps are now built within Linux with Wine to prevent mismatches.

0.3.1	Added an improved AMD/32-bit SSE2 algorithm that works on larger P.
	Added a shell script that auto-detects processor type and count.

0.3.0	New algorithm for sieving wide n ranges based on tpsieve by Geoff
	Reynolds and Ken Brazier.
